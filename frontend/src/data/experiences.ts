    description:
      `During my Internship at Tara Tools, I focused on the Design department's digital workflow for complex BIW and checking/welding fixtures. I analyzed how CATIA and NX architect high-precision models that ensure robotic accessibility and geometric accuracy. I observed how industrial planning transforms these designs into "software-defined blueprints" that drive automated CNC manufacturing. This provided a deep dive into Model-Based Definition, where digital design dictates every phase of shop-floor execution. I leveraged this to bridge mechanical precision with software logic, forming the foundation for the Digital Twin systems I build.`,
